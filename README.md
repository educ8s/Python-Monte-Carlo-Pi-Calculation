# Python-Monte-Carlo-Pi-Calculation
 Calculation of Pi using the Monte Carlo method and pygame for graphics.
 
 
Consider drawing random dots inside a square. Is it possible to estimate Pi, a specific irrational number which is used everywhere, from these points? Believe it or not, it is possible and that's exactly what we're going to accomplish in this video. Using a Python script, we will use randomization to estimate the value of Pi, and that’s our first, easy Python coding challenge, a new series on this channel where we try to solve interesting problems using programming.
